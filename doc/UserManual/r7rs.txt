R7RS Standard Libraries
-----------------------

The R7RS standard libraries are described by the
<<Standards, R7RS (small)>> standard approved in 2013
and by the
<<Standards, R7RS Red Edition>> standard approved in 2016.
The
<<R7rsPreDefinedSection,Predefined libraries>> section
of this manual lists the names of those libraries.

Larceny provides all of the R7RS standard libraries,
supports the full numeric tower, and can represent all
Unicode characters.

Binary releases of Larceny also support Unicode strings.
(When built from source code, Larceny can be configured to
use Latin-1 strings instead of Unicode.)

When Larceny is invoked with the `-r7r6` option on its
command line, all of the standard R7RS and R6RS libraries
are imported at startup.  When invoked with the `-r7`
option, only `(scheme base)` is imported at startup.

Known deviations from the R7RS standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify interoperability with R6RS libraries and
programs, and to improve the performance of flonum and
complex arithemetic, the `integer?`, `rational?`, and `real?`
procedures exported by `(scheme base)` have R6RS semantics.
It is not clear whether that is fully compatible with the
R7RS (small) standard, because the R7RS specification of
those procedures appears to contradict itself.

If any other R7RS feature is missing or incompatible with
the R7RS (small) standard, it's a bug.

As of Larceny v1.3, the known deviations are:

- `include` and `include-ci` do not work at expression level.
(`include` and `include-ci` are fully supported at the
top-level declaration and definition levels of R7RS libraries,
but not at expression level.)

- Libraries with names of the form `(primitives x ...)` cannot be imported.
(Larceny v1.3 reserves <<R7rsPrimitivesSection,primitives>>
as a keyword for importing identifiers from the R5RS global
environment.)

- Ellipses are not shadowed properly.
(Larceny v1.3 continues to give ellipses their usual meaning
in macro definitions whose context should have given ellipses
a different meaning:
